## Logo4500 Dataset Description
In this work, we introduced logo4500, the largest fully annotated logo-detection dataset, with 4,500 logo categories, more than 420,000 manually annotated logo objects, and 293,298 images. Logo4500 creates a more challenging benchmark for Logo detection because it has higher overall coverage and wider diversity in terms of flag categories and annotation objects than existing datasets. The statistical comparison of the 10 superclasses in Logo4500 is as follows:

| Category | Number | Image | Object | Pencentage | Content |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Food | 926 | 67,768 | 102,308 | 20.68% | Eggs, Dairy, Meat, Condiment, Fast food, Snack|
| Clothing | 752 | 42,985 | 50,341 | 16.94% | Dress, Shoes, Underwear, Hat |
| Toiletry | 480 | 35,380 | 58,976 | 10.81% | Cosmetic, Dentifrice, cleansing lotion, Shower Gel |
| Drink | 339 | 23,764 | 39,272 | 7.64% | Liquor, Fruit Juice, Portable water, Beverage |
| Electronics&Software | 313 | 19,535 | 29,182 | 7.09% | Computer, Phone, Audio, Software, Switch |
| Catering&Accommodation | 268 | 14,762 | 18,887 | 6.04% | Restaurant, Hotel, Caf√©, Dessert Shop |
| Vehicle | 189 | 11,289 | 14,603 | 4.26% | Car, Bicycle, Motor, Plane |
| Sport&Amusement | 161 | 9,317 | 12,392 | 3.63% | Sporting equipment, Toy, Game  |
| Others | 147 | 6,033 | 6,598 | 3.29% | Not included in Nice classification(e.g., Music,Anime) |
| Medicine&Hygiene& | 115 | 12,901 | 22,310 | 2.59% | Medicine, Nutrient, Tissue, Disinfectant |

## Logo4500 Dataset Detailed Statistics
The figure showns the detailed statistics of Logo4500 about Image and object distribution in per category, and the number of objects in per image and object size in per image.

The sorted distribution of images for each logo in Logo4500 is shown the figure. We can see that imbalanced distribution across different logo categories are one characteristic of Logo4500, posing a challenge for effective logo detection with few samples.

In addition, we performed a quantitative comparative analysis of these two datasets, Logo4500 and LogoDet-3K.
